# JDK 9 to JDK 21 Migration Transformation

## Objective
To upgrade Java applications from JDK 9 to JDK 21 and to upgrade MongoDB java driver to version 5.2.x, by systematically addressing compatibility issues, leveraging new language features, and ensuring compliance with updated APIs and security standards.

## Summary
This transformation migrates Java applications from JDK 9 to JDK 21 and migrates applications MongoDB java driver to version 5.2.x, by updating build configurations, addressing deprecated or removed APIs, adopting new language features, updating dependencies to JDK 21-compatible versions, and verifying compatibility with the enhanced module system. The process ensures that the application continues to function correctly while taking advantage of performance improvements and security enhancements available in JDK 21.

## Entry Criteria
1. Source code is currently compatible with JDK 9
2. All source files are accessible and can be modified
3. Build configuration files (Maven, Gradle, Ant, etc.) are available and can be modified
4. Test suites are available to verify the application's behavior after migration
5. Dependency information is available (direct and transitive dependencies)
6. Documentation on custom JVM arguments or JDK-specific configurations is available (if applicable)
7. Source uses MongoDB and requires driver upgrade to 5.2.x 

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Processing & Partitioning
1. Identify all Java source files in the project
2. Categorize files by module (if a modular application) or by package structure
3. Identify non-Java files that may contain Java version specifications:
   - Build files (pom.xml, build.gradle, etc.)
   - CI/CD configuration files (.gitlab-ci.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.)
   - Dockerfiles and container configurations
   - Shell scripts or batch files that reference Java or JDK
4. Create a list of third-party dependencies and their versions

### 2. Static Dependency Analysis
1. Analyze internal dependencies:
   - Identify usage of deprecated or removed JDK 9 APIs
   - Map dependencies between modules or packages
   - Document use of JDK-specific features that may have changed
2. Analyze external dependencies:
   - Create a list of all third-party libraries and their versions
   - Check each dependency for JDK 21 compatibility
   - Identify dependencies that need to be upgraded
   - Document dependencies that have known incompatibilities with JDK 21
   - **MongoDB Driver**: Upgrade from current version to 5.2.x for JDK 21 compatibility
3. Special handling requirements:
   - Document APIs that have changed behavior between JDK 9 and JDK 21
   - Identify use of internal APIs that may be encapsulated in JDK 21
   - Document reflection usage that may be affected by stronger encapsulation

### 3. Searching and Applying Specific Transformation Rules
1. Update build configuration:
   - Update Java version specifications to 21 in all build files
   - Adjust compiler settings for JDK 21 compatibility
   - Update plugin versions to those compatible with JDK 21
   - **MongoDB Driver**: Update to version 5.2.x in dependency management
2. Address deprecated or removed APIs:
   - Replace usage of `sun.*` packages with supported alternatives
   - Update usages of deprecated collection factory methods
   - Replace removed or deprecated security providers and algorithms
   - Address Security Manager deprecation warnings
3. Apply JDK 10-21 language feature changes:
   - Adopt local variable type inference where appropriate (var keyword)
   - Implement pattern matching for instanceof and switch statements
   - Update switch statements to use switch expressions and pattern matching
   - Replace traditional anonymous classes with lambda expressions where possible
   - Implement text blocks for multi-line string literals
   - Utilize record patterns where applicable
   - Apply string templates for complex string operations
   - Consider virtual threads for I/O-heavy operations
   - Update serialization mechanisms if needed
4. Update module declarations:
   - Adjust module-info.java files if present
   - Address changes in module exports and requires
   - Handle split packages and merged modules
5. Address JAXB and Java EE module removal:
   - Add explicit dependencies for javax.xml.bind if used
   - Add dependencies for JavaEE APIs that were removed from the JDK
   - **CRITICAL**: Add javax.annotation-api dependency to resolve javax.annotation.PostConstruct ClassNotFoundException
     - Add dependency: `javax.annotation:javax.annotation-api:1.3.2`
     - This fixes the common Spring Boot + JDK 21 compatibility issue where javax.annotation classes are missing
6. **MongoDB Driver Migration**:
   - Update MongoDB Java driver from current version to 5.2.x
   - Replace deprecated MongoDB API calls with new equivalents
   - Update connection string format if needed
   - Adjust MongoDB configuration classes for new driver API
   - Test MongoDB connectivity and CRUD operations with new driver

### 4. Searching for Past Successful Migration Transformations
1. Research common JDK 9 to JDK 21 migration patterns:
   - Identify standard approaches for handling removed APIs
   - Document best practices for module system changes
   - Apply patterns for updating security configurations
   - Review MongoDB driver 5.2.x migration guides and best practices
2. Incorporate lessons learned from community migrations:
   - Implement recommended dependency updates
   - Apply suggested compiler flags for compatibility
   - Use established techniques for handling deprecations
   - Apply MongoDB driver migration patterns from community experiences

### 5. Generating a sequence of fragments to be migrated based on the Dependency Analysis
1. Prioritize build configuration files:
   - Update JDK version settings to 21
   - Modify compiler plugin configurations
   - Update MongoDB driver dependency to 5.2.x
2. Update core infrastructure code:
   - Modify module-info.java files
   - Update security implementations
   - Adjust reflection usage
   - **Update MongoDB configuration classes for new driver**
3. Update application code from lowest to highest in dependency order:
   - Base utility classes
   - Core domain models
   - **MongoDB repository implementations and data access layer**
   - Service implementations
   - Controllers/UI components
4. Update test code:
   - Adjust test infrastructure
   - Update mocking frameworks if necessary
   - Modify test cases to account for API changes
   - **Update MongoDB test configurations and embedded MongoDB setup**

### 6. Step-by-Step Migration & Iterative Validation
1. Perform the migration in incremental steps:
   - Update build files to target JDK 21
   - Update MongoDB driver to 5.2.x
   - Run tests to identify immediate issues
   - Address compatibility issues one at a time
   - Refactor code to replace deprecated APIs
   - Apply new language features where beneficial
2. Validate each step:
   - Ensure the code compiles successfully
   - Run unit tests to verify behavior
   - Check for warning messages and address them
   - Perform integration testing to ensure system components work together
   - **Test MongoDB connectivity and operations with new driver**
3. Performance testing:
   - Compare application performance metrics before and after migration
   - Adjust garbage collector settings for optimal performance with JDK 21
   - Optimize code to take advantage of JDK 21 improvements
   - **Benchmark MongoDB operations with new driver version**

## Validation / Exit Criteria
1. All source code compiles successfully with JDK 21
2. All unit and integration tests pass
3. No usage of deprecated or removed APIs remains in the code
4. Application exhibits equivalent or better performance compared to the JDK 9 version
5. Security vulnerabilities addressed by JDK 21 are properly mitigated
6. All CI/CD pipelines run successfully with JDK 21
7. Documentation is updated to reflect the new JDK version and any changes to system requirements
8. Deployment scripts and configurations are updated to use JDK 21
9. **MongoDB driver 5.2.x is successfully integrated and all database operations function correctly**
10. **MongoDB connection pooling and configuration work properly with the new driver**
